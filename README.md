# ReMark Fronted

This is the ReMark client which is written in pure Vanilla JS. The styling is taken care by HTML5 and CSS3.

# Major Todo

- [] **Create a class to initialize and store globals**

- [] ~~**Create a function to make overlays**~~

- [] **Proper error handling :** Currently the code just logs the error. Need to improve the error modal component and create a generalized error handler

- [] **Update CSS :** Currently, the CSS code has duplications. Need to use `:root` to declare global stylings. This includes `colors`, `fonts`, `shadows`, etc. Have to make sure not to override the website's styling

- [] **Convert to ES6 Syntax :** Currently, we have to include multiple `script` tags. Need to convert all files to ES6 modules 

- [] **Bundle with `Parcel`**

- [] **Testing**
